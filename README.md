# bitburner-save-editor
Web-based editor for Bitburner save files. Upload your save (JSON/base64 or gzipped), tweak stats, factions, companies, servers, and augmentations, then download a fresh save ready to import. This fork continues work from the original project by Redmega (https://github.com/Redmega/bitburner-save-editor); credit to them for the foundation.
