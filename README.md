# Bitburner Save Editor

Web-based editor for Bitburner save files. Upload your save (JSON/base64 or gzipped), tweak stats, factions, companies, servers, and augmentations, then download a fresh save ready to import. This fork continues work from the original project by Redmega (https://github.com/Redmega/bitburner-save-editor); credit to them for the foundation.

## Usage

https://redmega.github.io/bitburner-save-editor/

Open the save editor and upload your exported Bitburner save file. When you're done editing, you can click the download icon in the header to get a new version of your save that you can import to the game.
